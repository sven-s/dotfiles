# This option is a variant of INC_APPEND_HISTORY in which, where possible, the
# history entry is written out to the file after the command is finished, so
# that the time taken by the command is recorded correctly in the history file
# in EXTENDED_HISTORY format. This means that the history entry will not be
# available immediately from other instances of the shell that are using the
# same history file.

# Remove command lines from the history list when the first character on the
# line is a space, or when one of the expanded aliases contains a leading space.

# directly; instead, perform history expansion and reload the line into the
# editing buffer.

# Remove superfluous blanks from each command line being added to the history
# list.
setopt hist_reduce_blanks

# By default, shell history that is read in from files is split into words on
# all white space. This means that arguments with quoted whitespace are not
# correctly handled, with the consequence that references to words in history
# lines that have been read from a file may be inaccurate. When this option is
# set, words read in from a history file are divided up in a similar fashion to
# normal shell command line handling.
